# Customer Segmentation Using Machine Learning

### Objective
Develop a clustering model to uncover customer segments based on both:
1. Aggregate sales patterns.
2. Specific items purchased.

This project employs Unsupervised Learning techniques, specifically K-Means clustering, to achieve the objective.

### Approach
1. **Dataset**: The input dataset, containing past purchase transaction details.
2. **Workflow**: 
   - Conduct data analysis to understand and preprocess the dataset.
   - Implement clustering using the **K-Means algorithm**.
